# JavaScript-Music-Player
![sample image](https://raw.github.com/stratonis/JavaScript-Music-Player/master/sampleimage.png)

This music player is designed to live in the footer of the webpage, originally created for hosting archives, to allow a very small amount of audio files to be sampled. 

Based on [the Geeks for Geeks Music Player](https://github.com/sayantanm19/js-music-player), with the main differences being the album functionality and visual style of being in the footer.

# Usage
Warning, this project is in a very early state.

- In songs.js, objects can be created for different albums, each containing song information and paths.
- In index.html, the "section containing clickable albums" must contain the parameter for the javascript objects mentioned above.
