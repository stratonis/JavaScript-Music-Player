# JavaScript-Music-Player
![sample image](https://raw.github.com/stratonis/JavaScript-Music-Player/master/sampleimage.png)

This music player is designed to live in the footer of the webpage, originally created for hosting archives, to allow a very small amount of audio files to be sampled. 

Based on [the Geeks for Geeks Music Player](https://github.com/sayantanm19/js-music-player), with the main differences being the album functionality and visual style of being in the footer.

# Usage
Warning, this project is in a very early state.

In songs.js, objects can be created for different albums, each containing song information and paths.
In index.html, the "section containing clickable albums" must contain the parameter for the javascript objects mentioned above.
